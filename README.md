Abstract
The advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision have enabled numerous real-world applications, including security and surveillance systems. This project introduces a robust system for detecting physical assault in surveillance footage by leveraging a combination of YOLO-Pose for skeletal pose estimation and a deep learning classifier based on ResNet50. The model was trained on 468 labeled RGB images with corresponding skeletal data to distinguish assault scenarios from non-assault scenarios effectively. This system aims to provide real-time detection capabilities to enhance public safety and support law enforcement.

Chapter 1: Introduction
The rising concerns around public safety necessitate innovative solutions to identify and respond to violent incidents promptly. Traditional surveillance systems rely on human monitoring, which is prone to errors and inefficiencies. Integrating AI with these systems enables automated and accurate detection of violence, allowing for quicker responses.
This project focuses on utilizing pose estimation and deep learning to create an assault detection system. By detecting skeletal poses in video frames and classifying actions as violent or non-violent, the system bridges the gap between surveillance and active intervention. The following sections describe the development process, methodology, results, and potential applications of the proposed solution.
